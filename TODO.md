C# built build system for c++ projects

recipe that describe a library, how to build it from source, similar to homebrew
cli tool to query recipes (use homebrew git model?)
main target: OSX
use cmake!?
ability to specify in own “recipe” what dependencies are needed for my software
serve pre-built (& gpg signed) binaries for packages

start out by offering a small set of ready libs:
